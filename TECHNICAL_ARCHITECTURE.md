# TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE DOCUMENT
## Quantum Swarm Trader - Fractal Clone System

### 1. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

#### 1.1 Core Components
- **Master Orchestrator**: Primary bot that manages clone lifecycle
- **Clone Registry**: Distributed ledger of all active clones
- **Swarm Communication Layer**: Redis Pub/Sub for real-time coordination
- **Capital Pool Contract**: Smart contract for trustless fund sharing
- **Quantum Decision Engine**: Neural network for strategy selection

#### 1.2 Infrastructure Requirements
```yaml
Master Node:
  - AWS c5.2xlarge (8 vCPU, 16GB RAM)
  - Redis cluster (3 nodes)
  - Multi-region deployment

Clone Instances:
  - AWS Lambda (3GB RAM, 15-min timeout)
  - Auto-scaling 0-1000 concurrent
  - Geographic distribution
```

### 2. CLONE SPAWNING MECHANISM

#### 2.1 Spawning Thresholds
- Generation 0: Spawn at $500
- Generation 1: Spawn at $2,000 
- Generation 2: Spawn at $5,000
- Generation 3: Spawn at $10,000
- Max generations: 5 (prevent runaway)

#### 2.2 Genetic Mutations
Each clone inherits parent strategies with 10% mutation rate:
- Strategy weights (±20% variance)
- Risk parameters (±15% variance)
- Behavioral traits (unique per clone)
- Trading schedule (randomized)
### 3. ANTI-DETECTION SYSTEMS

#### 3.1 Behavioral Differentiation
```python
class BehavioralProfile:
    - response_delay: 100-2000ms (random per clone)
    - order_size_variance: ±20% from base
    - preferred_exchanges: shuffled list
    - active_hours: randomized schedule
    - decision_threshold: ±0.5% from parent
```

#### 3.2 Network Obfuscation
- Rotating residential proxies (100+ IPs)
- Unique user agents per clone
- Random WebRTC fingerprints
- TLS fingerprint randomization
- Request timing jitter

### 4. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

#### 4.1 Smart Contract Pool
```solidity
contract SwarmCapitalPool {
    mapping(address => uint256) cloneBalances;
    mapping(bytes32 => bool) opportunityLocks;
    
    function requestCapital(uint256 amount, bytes32 oppId) external {
        require(!opportunityLocks[oppId], "Already claimed");
        require(totalPoolBalance() >= amount, "Insufficient pool");
        opportunityLocks[oppId] = true;
        // Transfer logic
    }
}
```

#### 4.2 Flash Loan Integration
- Aave V3: Up to $50M USDC
- dYdX: Up to $20M ETH
- Balancer: Up to $30M multi-asset
- Cascade for larger opportunities

### 5. REAL-TIME COORDINATION

#### 5.1 Redis Message Protocol
```
Channel Structure:
- swarm:opportunities - New opportunities broadcast
- swarm:claims - Opportunity claim notifications  
- swarm:results - Trade results sharing
- swarm:heartbeat - Clone health monitoring
```

#### 5.2 Consensus Mechanism
- Opportunity scoring by multiple clones
- 60% agreement required for high-risk trades
- Instant execution for MEV opportunities
- Profit sharing based on discovery + capital
