## My Recommendation

**For Quantum Swarm Trader, I recommend:**

1. **Start with:** Textual TUI + FastAPI/Next.js PWA
2. **Why:** 
   - TUI gives instant server monitoring
   - PWA provides professional web + mobile in one
   - Can develop both in parallel
   - Total time: 1-2 weeks

3. **Later add:** Native app if you get 100+ users

## Cost Analysis

| Solution | Development Time | Monthly Cost | Maintenance |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| TUI Only | 1-2 days | $0 | Low |
| Streamlit | 2-3 days | $0-50 | Low |
| Web PWA | 1-2 weeks | $20-100 | Medium |
| Native Apps | 4-6 weeks | $100-500 | High |

## Final Decision Helper

Choose **TUI** if:
- You primarily manage via SSH
- You want zero dependencies
- You need it working TODAY

Choose **Web PWA** if:
- You need mobile access
- You want professional UI
- Multiple users will access it

Choose **Both** if:
