### RISK THRESHOLDS & KILL SWITCHES

**Automatic Halt Conditions**:
- Daily loss exceeds 20% of capital
- More than 3 exchange restrictions
- Network fees exceed 30% of profits
- Clone mortality rate >50% in 24h

**Manual Override Triggers**:
- Regulatory action detected
- Smart contract vulnerability found
- Systematic strategy failure
- Market black swan event

### REALISTIC CONSTRAINTS

**Technical Limitations**:
- AWS Lambda: 1000 concurrent limit
- Exchange APIs: 1200 requests/min
- Ethereum gas: $50-500 per complex tx
- Network latency: 50-200ms average

**Financial Limitations**:
- Initial capital: $100 only
- No external funding assumed
- Infrastructure costs: ~$500/month
- Must be profitable by day 30

**Regulatory Considerations**:
- US exchanges require KYC
- EU MiCA compliance needed
- Tax reporting requirements
- AML transaction limits
