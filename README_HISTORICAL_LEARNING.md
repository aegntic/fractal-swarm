# Historical Learning Swarm System

## Overview

I've created a comprehensive swarm system for gathering historical data and learning from the past with future-blind simulations. The system ensures unbiased decision-making by preventing agents from seeing future data during historical simulations.

## Components

### 1. Historical Data Collection Agents (`agents/historical_data_collector.py`)
- **HistoricalDataCollector**: Individual agent that collects OHLCV data from exchanges
- **HistoricalDataSwarm**: Manages multiple collectors working in parallel
- **DataWindow**: Ensures future-blind data access during simulations

Key features:
- Multi-exchange support (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken)
- Multi-timeframe data collection (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, etc.)
- Technical indicator calculation
- Redis caching for persistence
- Parallel data collection for efficiency

### 2. Future-Blind Simulator (`backtesting/future_blind_simulator.py`)
- **FutureBlindSimulator**: Core backtesting engine that prevents look-ahead bias
- **TradingStrategy**: Abstract base for implementing strategies
- **ParallelBacktestRunner**: Runs multiple backtests concurrently

Key features:
- Time-stepped simulation (agents only see data up to current simulation time)
- Realistic execution modeling (slippage, fees, delays)
- Risk management (position sizing, maximum exposure)
- Performance metrics (Sharpe ratio, drawdown, win rate)

### 3. Learning Agents (`historical_learning_swarm.py`)
- **LearningAgent**: Agent that learns patterns from historical data
- **HistoricalLearningSwarm**: Coordinates the entire learning process

Learning process:
1. Extract features from visible market data
2. Execute trades based on current knowledge
3. Analyze results to identify profitable patterns
4. Update pattern recognition for future trades
5. Deploy best-performing agents to production

### 4. Integration
The system integrates with your existing swarm coordinator to:
- Deploy learned strategies as new trading agents
- Share profitable patterns across the swarm
- Continuously improve through ongoing learning

## Usage

```python
# Initialize the learning swarm
learning_swarm = HistoricalLearningSwarm(
    num_collectors=5,  # Number of data collection agents
    num_learners=10    # Number of learning agents
)

# Start learning from historical data
await learning_swarm.initialize()
await learning_swarm.collect_and_learn(
    symbols=['BTC/USDT', 'ETH/USDT', 'SOL/USDT'],
    days_back=30
)

# Run continuous learning loop
await learning_swarm.continuous_learning_loop()
```

## Key Features

### Future-Blind Simulation
- Agents can only see data up to the current simulation time
- No look-ahead bias - decisions are made with incomplete information
- Realistic execution with slippage and fees

### Pattern Learning
- Agents identify profitable patterns in historical data
- Patterns are validated across multiple time periods
- Only consistently profitable patterns are retained

### Swarm Intelligence
- Multiple agents learn different aspects of the market
- Best performers share their knowledge with the swarm
- Continuous adaptation to changing market conditions

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify functionality:
```bash
python test_historical_learning.py
```

## Configuration

Set these environment variables:
- `BINANCE_API_KEY`: Binance API key (optional for public data)
- `BINANCE_SECRET`: Binance API secret
- `COINBASE_API_KEY`: Coinbase API key
- `COINBASE_SECRET`: Coinbase API secret

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Unbiased Learning**: Future-blind simulation ensures strategies work with realistic constraints
2. **Scalable**: Swarm approach allows parallel data collection and strategy testing
3. **Adaptive**: Continuous learning from new market data
4. **Risk-Aware**: Built-in risk management and position sizing
5. **Production-Ready**: Learned strategies can be deployed directly to trading
